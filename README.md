What is Email Spoofing

Email spoofing is the creation of email messages with a forged sender address. The original transmission protocols used for email do not have built-in authentication methods: this deficiency allows spam and phishing emails to use spoofing in order to mislead the recipient. In simple words, you can send email to anybody from any* email address using this application.
